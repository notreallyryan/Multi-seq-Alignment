# Multi-seq-Alignment

In almost all aspects of computational biology, sequence alignment is one of the very first steps in data processing. Aligning sequences allows for accurate comparison of DNA or protein sequences. By comparing sequences, biologists can find common structures and functionalities between them, and further analyze their evolutionary relationship.

Basic sequence alingment can be computed using the Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm, though some more modern approaches have explored using Markov Models. The algorithm is explained in depth here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm
